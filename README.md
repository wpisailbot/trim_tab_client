# trim_tab_client

Rewritten trim-tab communication system, using Websockets instead of BLE this time. 
This runs on an ESP32, connects to a wifi network (sailbot_trimtab_ap) generated by the boat's main controller, and finds the appropriate websocket server/port using mDNS (sailbot must broadcast over Avahi or similar).
Once connected, the two communicate by passing Protobuf messages defined here: https://github.com/wpisailbot/trim_tab_messages
