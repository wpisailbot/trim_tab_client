# trim_tab_client

Rewritten trim-tab communication system, using Websockets instead of BLE this time. 
This runs on an ESP32, connects to a wifi network (sailbot_trimtab_ap) generated by the ESP32 on the mainboard, and finds the appropriate websocket server/port using mDNS.
Once connected, the two communicate by passing JSON messages.
